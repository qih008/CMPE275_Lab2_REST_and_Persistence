API Path: ec2-54-67-125-74.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/

the only different between this source code and online verison is db username and password.
This source code is using localhost as api path, and local mysql as database,
the online version is using EC2 url as api path, and AWS RDS as database,
because I don't want to upload my RDS username and pasword online.

Screenshots are in folder screenshots under project root dir

Hope this ec2 can constant working correctly for the next three week,
If you find my api didn't work, please contact me before take my points
off. Thanks!!

Description:
CMPE 275 Section 2, Fall 2017
Lab 2 - REST and Persistence
Last updated: 10/31/2017 ( draft )
In this lab, you build a set of REST APIs to manage entities and relationships in a mini gaming
website (you can give your own fancy name for it). The API needs to be hosted in either
Amazon EC2, Google App Engine, Or Compute Engine. You must use JPA for persistence, and
each API method must be transactional.
There are two primary types of entities: Players and Sponsors. They have the following
relationships and constraints:
● Opponents: if two players play against each other, they are opponents. The opponent
relationship is symmetric in that is Alice is an opponent of Bob, then Bob is also an
opponent of Alice. A player can have zero or more opponent players.
● Sponsors: a player can optionally be sponsored by an external sponsor. Different
players can have the same sponsor.
● The firstname, lastname, and email fields are required for any player. Emails have to be
unique across players.
● The name field is required for any Sponsor, and does not need to be unique.
Partial definition of the related classes are provided below. While the Address class is defined
for convenience and clarity, you are recommended to embed addresses and not to store them
as separate entities.
package edu.sjsu.cmpe275.lab2;
public class Player {
private long id;
private String firstname;
private String lastname;
private String email;
private String description;
private Address address;
private Sponsor sponsor;
private List<Player> opponents;
// constructors, setters, getters, etc.
}
public class Address {
private String street;
private String city;
private String state;
private String zip;
...
}
public class Sponsor {
private long id;
private String name;
private String description;
private Address address;
...
}
You need to persist these entities in a non-volatile database of your own choice. You may want
to create three tables, PLAYER, SPONSOR, and OPPONENTS.
To manage these entities and their relationships, you are asked to provide the following REST
APIs. The paths below are relative to the base URL of your app.
Player APIs
(1) Create a player
Path: player?firstname=XX&lastname=YY&email=ZZ&description=UU&street=VV$...
Method: POST
This API creates a player object.
For simplicity, all the player fields (firstname, lastname, email, street, city, sponsor, etc), except
ID and opponents,are passed in as query parameters. Only the firstname, lastname, and email
are required. Anything else is optional. Opponents is not allowed to be passed in as a
parameter.
The sponsor parameter, if present, must be the ID of an existing sponsor. The request returns
the newly created player object in JSON in its HTTP payload, including all attributes. (Please
note this differs from generally recommended practice of only returning the ID.) If the request is
invalid, e.g., missing required parameters, the HTTP status code should be 400; otherwise 200.
(2) Get a player
Path:player/{id}
Method: GET
This returns a full player object in JSON in its HTTP payload.
All existing fields, including the optional sponsor and list of opponents should be returned.
The JSON should contain the full sponsor object, if present.
The list of opponents can be either (a) list of player IDs, or (b) list of “shallow” player objects that
do not have their opponents list populated. If you take option (b), you want to use techniques
like lazy loading to avoid serializing the whole game network starting from the requested player
in the JSON to be returned.
If the player of the given user ID does not exist, the HTTP return code should be 404; otherwise,
200.
(3) Update a player
Path: player/{id}?firstname=XX&lastname=YY&email=ZZ&description=UU&street=VV$...
Method: POST
This API updates a player object.
For simplicity, all the player fields (firstname, lastname, email, street, city, sponsor, etc), except
opponents, should be passed in as query parameters. Required fields like email must be
present. The object constructed from the parameters will completely replace the existing object
in the server, except that it does not change the player’s list of opponents.
Similar to the get method, the request returns the updated player object, including all attributes
(first name, last name, email, opponents, sponsor, etc), in JSON. If the player ID does not exist,
404 should be returned. If required parameters are missing, return 400 instead. Otherwise,
return 200.
(4) Delete a player
URL: http://player/{id}
Method: DELETE
This deletes the player object with the given ID.
If the player with the given ID does not exist, return 404.
Otherwise, delete the player and remove any reference of this player from your persistence of
opponent relations, and return HTTP status code 200 and the deleted player in JSON.
Sponsor APIs
(5) Create an sponsor
Path: sponsor?name=XX&description=YY&street=ZZ&...
Method: POST
This API creates an sponsor object.
For simplicity, all the fields (name, description, street, city, etc), except ID, are passed in as
query parameters. Only name is required.
The request returns the newly created sponsor object in JSON in its HTTP payload, including all
attributes. (Please note this differs from generally recommended practice of only returning the
ID.)
If the request is invalid, e.g., missing required parameters, the HTTP status code should be 400;
otherwise 200.
(6) Get a sponsor
Path:sponsor/{id}
Method: GET
This returns a full sponsor object in JSON in its HTTP payload.
All existing fields, including name, description, street, and city, should be returned.
If the sponsor of the given ID does not exist, the HTTP return code should be 404; otherwise,
200.
(7) Update a sponsor
Path: sponsor/{id}?name=XX&description=YY&street=ZZ&...
Method: POST
This API updates a sponsor object.
For simplicity, all the fields (name, description, street, city, etc), except ID, are passed in as
query parameters. Only name is required.
Similar to the get method, the request returns the updated sponsor object, including all
attributes in JSON. If the sponsor ID does not exist, 404 should be returned. If required
parameters are missing, return 400 instead. Otherwise, return 200.
(8) Delete a sponsor
URL: http://sponsor/{id}
Method: DELETE
This method deletes the sponsor object with the given ID.
If there is still any player belonging to this sponsor, return 400.
If the sponsor with the given ID does not exist, return 404.
Return HTTP code 200 and the deleted object in JSON if the object is deleted;
Opponent’s APIs
(9) Add an opponent
Path:opponents/{id1}/{id2}
Method: PUT
This makes the two players with the given IDs opponents with each other.
If either player does not exist, return 404.
If the two players are already opponents, do nothing, just return 200. Otherwise,
Record this opponent relation. If all is successful, return HTTP code 200 and any informative
text message in the HTTP payload.
(10) Remove an opponent
Path:opponents/{id1}/{id2}
Method: DELETE
This request removes the opponent relation between the two players.
If either player does not exist, return 404.
If the two players are not opponents, return 404. Otherwise,
Remove this opponent relation. Return HTTP code 200 and a meaningful text message if all is
successful.
Additional Requirements/Constraints
● This is a group assignment for up to three team members.
● You must use JPA and persist the user data into a database. For database, you must
use MySQL, Google App Engine Datastore, Cloud Datastore, or Cloud Spanner.
● You MUST show your group number (e.g., <title>Group 2: User</title>) in the title of
every HTML you return in (1)-(4).
● Please add proper JavaDoc comments.
● You must keep your server running for at least three weeks upon submission. Once your
code is submitted to Canvas, you cannot make any further deployment/upload to your
app in the server, or it will be considered as late submission or even cheating. You may
be asked to show the server log and deployment history upon the TA’s request.
Submission
1. Please submit through Canvas the whole folder of your source code and resources,
including build files. Do not include libs, jars or compiled class files.
2. Please include at least ten screenshots, one for each formatted JSON or text message
returned by the ten requests.
3. You must sign up as a group under Groups for Lab 2, and the team must submit as a
group.
Grading
This lab has a total point of 9, with 8 points for correctness and 1 points for code structure clarity
and Java documentation.
You MUST keep your API running in the cloud until the grading is finished.
